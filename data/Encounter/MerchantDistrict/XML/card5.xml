            Walking along the dock you see something floating in the water near the edge of the dock. You reach for it - make a Luck (-1) check. If you pass, you dredge up something useful. Draw 1 Common Item. If you fail, you pull to the surface a tentacle that immediately wraps around your neck and drags you under the water and out to sea. Lose 1 Sanity and 3 Stamina before you can break free.
